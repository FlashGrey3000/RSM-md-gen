# Problem Description
- Begin with a clear, detailed explanation of the algorithmic problem
- State any constraints on input size, time complexity, or space complexity
- Identify the inputs and expected outputs
- Highlight any edge cases or special scenarios to consider
- Note any specific algorithmic requirements or constraints

# Data Definitions
- Define the input and output formats
- Explain any constants or special values used
- Document the purpose of key variables
- Provide examples of valid inputs and outputs

# Program Construction

## Function Construction

### 1. Specification
- Write function signature
- State the purpose of the function
- PRECONDITION: List all conditions that must be true before the function executes
- POSTCONDITION: List all conditions that will be true after the function executes
- Document parameters and return values using docstrings

### 2. Examples
- Provide at least three diverse edge test cases
- Include normal cases, edge cases, and base cases (especially for recursive solutions)
- Show example function calls and expected outputs
- Explain why each example is important

### 3. Trace
- Walk through a complete example step by step
- Show the recursive call stack for recursive solutions
- Demonstrate key algorithmic steps
- Explain the reasoning at each step
- Track important variable changes

### 4. Algorithm Design
- Break down the problem into smaller steps
- Explain the chosen algorithmic approach
- Discuss alternative approaches considered
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Address optimization opportunities

### 5. Algorithm
- Present pseudo-code focusing on the core algorithm
- Include comments explaining each major step
- Show recursive relationships if applicable
- Address base cases and edge cases
- Note any important invariants

### 6. Program
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    
    # Purpose: Clear statement of function's purpose
    
    # Args:
    #     param1: description
        
    # Returns:
    #     description of return value
    
    # Implementation following the algorithm design
    pass
```

Rules:
1. Focus on algorithmic clarity and correctness
2. Include comprehensive docstrings
3. Use clear parameter and return value documentation
4. Follow Python naming conventions
5. Add comments to explain complex algorithmic steps
6. Clearly document recursive relationships
7. Analyze and state complexity in Big O notation
8. Handle invalid inputs through logical conditions rather than exceptions

system_prompt_sample = """After completing the analysis, provide detailed examples and trace following this format:

# Examples
- Provide at least three diverse test cases covering:
  - Normal case with typical input
  - Edge case testing boundaries
  - Base case (especially for recursive solutions)
- For each example include:
  - Input values
  - Expected output
  - Explanation of why this case is important
- Show actual function calls and their results
- Verify that examples satisfy preconditions and postconditions

# Trace
- Select one example (preferably the normal case)
- Walk through the complete execution step by step
- For recursive solutions:
  - Show the full recursive call stack
  - Demonstrate how base cases are reached
  - Illustrate how results combine
- Track and explain:
  - Variable changes at each step
  - Decision points and their outcomes
  - How the algorithm progresses toward the solution
- Verify that the trace demonstrates correctness

Rules for Both Sections:
1. Keep solutions purely algorithmic without exception handling
2. Use clear parameter and return value documentation
3. Follow Python naming conventions
4. Add comments for complex steps
5. Document recursive relationships clearly
6. Use logical conditions for input validation"""
